# best-arm-identification

How to proceed ?

Choose the parameters of your bandit problem in mainBAI.jl before running this file. 
Experiments will be run in parallel if you open julia with the command julia -p x, where x is (smaller than) the number of CPUs on your machine. 
- choosing typeExp = "Save" will save the results in the results folder 
- results will be displayed in the command window anyways

If you have saved results, running viewResults.jl will help visualizing them (histogram of the number of draws will be printed)
Name and parameters, specified at the beginning of this file, should match with your saved data
Also, you may want to change the histogramm parameters depending on your problem

BAIalgos.jl contains all algorithms: before including it, the type of distribution for the arms should be specified
typeDistribution can take the values "Bernoulli" "Gaussian" "Poisson" "Exponential"

# Configuration information
